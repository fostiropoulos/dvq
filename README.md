# Depthwise Neural Discrete Representation Learning

Under the assumption that features should be indepedent density functions, we are able to improve the performance of VQVAE by 33% as compared to the original paper. 

Please see Examples in CIFAR10_DVQ.py


## TODO: 
- [ ] Port code entirely to TF2
- [ ] Integrate with sonnet
- [ ] Evalaute learned prior on conditioned PixelCNN and PixelCNN++
